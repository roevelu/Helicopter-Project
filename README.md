ENCE361 Helicopter project.
The code controls a toy which is constrained to
only yaw and move up and down. The code is designed
for the TM4C123G Tiva microcontroller and uses:
- ADC converters, and quadrature encoders for sensors
- Buttons to control setpoints
- A switch for flight modes
- PWM outputs for the controller (two DC motors)
- A timer triggered scheduler
- Interrupt based foreground tasks
- An OLED display
- UART for communication to the terminal
Enjoy!
